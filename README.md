Hey there!👋 I'm Kushal, an AI Engineer based in India 🇮🇳. 

I thrive on bringing imaginative ideas to life, from training models to deploying end-to-end solutions. If an idea pops into my head, chances are I'll build it and ship it.

Core Stack (Front-end & Deployment): React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Framer Motion.

AI/ML Toolset: Python (of course!), PyTorch/TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and cloud platforms like AWS/GCP for deployment.

I've got a bunch of pinned projects, but my favorite is the Anime Scene Gallery, where I blend my front-end skills with computer vision/ML.

I've built over 100 public repos (and probably more than 200 privately 🤫). Let's build the future!
